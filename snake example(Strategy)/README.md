# üêç Strategy Pattern - Snake Bite Behavior System (Java)

This project demonstrates the **Strategy Design Pattern** using a simple snake system where different snakes (poisonous and non-poisonous) have different **bite behaviors**.

---

## üìå Intent

**Strategy Pattern** is used to define a family of algorithms (behaviors), encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

> In this system, snakes can change their bite behavior (poisonous or non-poisonous) at runtime without altering the `Snake` class.

---

## üéØ Use Case

- Model snakes with different bite behaviors.
- Allow dynamic change of bite behavior during runtime.
- Separate the behavior logic from the main class (Snake).
- Demonstrate a simple real-life example of the Strategy Pattern for learning purposes.

## üë• Participants

| Class             | Role                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BiteBehavior`    | Strategy interface. Defines the bite behavior method.                |
| `PoisonousBite`   | Concrete strategy. Implements venomous snake behavior.               |
| `NonPoisonousBite`| Concrete strategy. Implements harmless bite behavior.                |
| `Snake`           | Context class. Uses a `BiteBehavior` to delegate the bite behavior.  |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Consequences

‚úÖ **Advantages:**
- **Flexible**: Can change behavior at runtime using `setBiteBehavior()`.
- **Clean Code**: Behavior is separated from the `Snake` class.
- **Open/Closed Principle**: New bite behaviors can be added without modifying existing code.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages:**
- Increases number of classes.
- Might be overkill for very simple behaviors unless extensibility is needed.

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Compile the code using `javac StrategyPatternDemo.java`
2. Run using `java StrategyPatternDemo`
